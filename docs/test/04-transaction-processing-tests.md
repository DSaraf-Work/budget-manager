---

## 5. Transaction Date Extraction

### Date Format Recognition

- [ ] Date parsing errors don't crash the system

---

## 6. Transaction Type Classification

### Debit Transactions
- [ ] "Debited" keyword triggers debit classification
- [ ] "Purchase" keyword triggers debit classification
- [ ] "Payment" keyword triggers debit classification
- [ ] "Spent" keyword triggers debit classification

### Credit Transactions
- [ ] "Credited" keyword triggers credit classification
- [ ] "Received" keyword triggers credit classification
- [ ] "Refund" keyword triggers credit classification
- [ ] "Cashback" keyword triggers credit classification

### Transfer Transactions
- [ ] "Transfer" keyword triggers transfer classification
- [ ] "Sent" keyword triggers transfer classification
- [ ] "Moved" keyword triggers transfer classification

---

## 7. Confidence Scoring

### High Confidence Transactions
- [ ] Transactions with all fields extracted get high scores (>0.8)
- [ ] Transactions from reliable senders get high scores
- [ ] Well-formatted emails get high scores

### Medium Confidence Transactions
- [ ] Transactions with some missing fields get medium scores (0.6-0.8)
- [ ] Transactions from unknown senders get medium scores

### Low Confidence Transactions
- [ ] Transactions with minimal data get low scores (<0.6)
- [ ] Malformed emails get low scores
- [ ] Ambiguous transactions get low scores

### Confidence Score Accuracy
- [ ] Confidence scores correlate with extraction quality
- [ ] High confidence transactions are generally accurate
- [ ] Low confidence transactions are flagged appropriately

---

## 8. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Malformed Emails
- [ ] Emails with no amount are skipped gracefully
